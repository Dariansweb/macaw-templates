Macaw provides the same flexibility as your favorite image editor but also writes semantic HTML and remarkably succinct CSS. It's time to expect more from a web design tool. [Check it out] (http://macaw.co). I often use Macaw to knock up proof of concepts for clients before I hand code them and wanted to give back to the community. This repo will be a place in which I share all websites I build with Macaw. These sites are by no means finished as I built them sheerly for design purposes, but I hope they help anyway!

Recruiters these aren't my real credentials. You can download my resume [here] (https://github.com/raynesandrew/Resume) - download the InDesign file if you wish to gain some inspiration. This theme was just a mock up, I now plan to hand code my resume from scratch and add it to my [personal site] (http://andrewraynes.com).
