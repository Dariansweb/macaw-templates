Macaw-Templates
===============

I often use Macaw to knock up proof of concept sites for clients before I hand code them. Although most the sites I share here won't be fully responsive or use semantic HTML - they may still be of use.

Feel free to raise any issues and or contribute to this repo.

Note: I hope to spare a minute to make these templates fully mobile and clean in terms of HTML/CSS in the days to come!
