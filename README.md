Macaw provides the same flexibility as your favorite image editor but also writes semantic HTML and remarkably succinct CSS. It's time to expect more from a web design tool. [Check it out] (http://macaw.co). I often use Macaw to knock up proof of concept sites for clients before I hand code them.

Use these templates as you wish. If you wish to add to the library raise an issue.
